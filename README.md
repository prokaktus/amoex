Async MOEX Python API
========

**Work in progress**

Implemented only subset of API, because docs is very poor and I personally use only free features.

If you want more, please notify me about that or provide PRs!

### Limitations

Python 3. Ha-ha-ha. Because Python 3 is cool and Python 2 is **TOOOOOO OLD**.
